# MyNeuralNetwork

A Neural Network implemented from scratch
based on the following tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6

It is a 3-layer Neural Network. The input has 3 features, the first hidden layer has 4 nodes, the second has 3 nodes,
and the output layer has 1 node.

What is missing:
 - Add bias
 - Use it for a real dataset
 - Implement a train function
 - Maybe create a function to automatic add more layers
 - Use a different activation function in the first two layers
 - Plot the loss function curve
